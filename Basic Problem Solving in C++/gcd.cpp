/*
Find the GCD of the given values
GCD is also known as HCF.

RULES:
1. Find all dividors
2. Find all common dividors
3. Find the largest common dividor

Example: 
12 =  1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 12
16 =  1 , 2 , 4 , 16

So common is here {1,2,4}
And largest common dividor is 4.

So the GCD of 12 and 16 is 4.
