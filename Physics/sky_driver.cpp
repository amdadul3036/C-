/*
A sky driver of mass, m fall vertically downward at time t = 0 , he attains a velocity v and 
opens the parachute. The force of air resistance , b is proportional to the velocity . The 
velocity at any time t is given by ,

v(t) = mg/b + (v - mg / b) e^(-bt/m);

Write a C++ function double vel() that returns the velocity at time t.
